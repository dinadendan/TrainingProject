        <p>Dear Harvard Extension School Students,

            On behalf of the entire Harvard Extension School team of faculty and staff, I am delighted to invite you to join us in a long-standing academic tradition of excellence and innovation in continuing education. 
            <br>
            
            Harvard Extension was the first Ivy League institution in the US to offer a degree program specifically designed for working adult students in the form of a high-quality undergraduate education that did not interfere with full-time employment. Harvard Extension was also the first school at Harvard to commit to offering part-time study, adopt open enrollment, and champion distance education.
            The Harvard Extension team is personally dedicated to continuing both the School’s rich history of trailblazing and its time-honored mission of offering accessible, affordable, and inclusive education.
            <br>

            Wherever you want to study or wherever you live, we are here for you. Most of our courses are taught online. But our “online” is different. We call it “human learning done online.” Our most popular remote offerings offer real-time faculty and peer interaction. We prioritize learning in community, not isolation. </p>
