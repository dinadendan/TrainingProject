    <h1> About us ...</h1>
    <h2> We Are Harvard : </h2>
    <p>Since our founding in 1910, we have extended Harvard University to the world — to adult learners who have the curiosity and drive to be challenged. Part of the Harvard Division of Continuing Education, we serve students seeking part-time online courses and programs to advance their careers or pursue an academic passion.We are a fully accredited Harvard school. Our degrees and certificates are adorned with the Harvard University insignia. They carry the weight of that lineage. Our graduates walk at University Commencement and become members of the Harvard Alumni Association.</p>

<div class="history">
    <h2>Our History: Inclusive & Accessible from the Beginning</h2>
    <p>The origin of Harvard Extension School can be traced back to 1835—when John Lowell Jr. founded the Lowell Institute. 

        In his will, Lowell Jr. funded an organization that provided Boston with free public lectures on a variety of subjects. The institute quickly gained an influential presence. Oliver Wendell Holmes, a lecturer at the institute, remarked, “No nobler or more helpful institution exists in America than Boston’s Lowell Institute.”
        
        In 1906–07, A. Lawrence Lowell, a trustee of the Lowell Institute and Harvard professor of government, revealed a plan to offer public courses in collaboration with Harvard University. And when Lowell became president of Harvard, he made that vision a reality. 
        
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> In 1910, Lowell founded the Commission on Extension Courses—hailed by the Boston Evening Transcript as “a new milestone” in education. He saw the commission as an experiment in “popular education.” The goal was to serve those in the community who had the ability and desire to attend college, but had other obligations that kept them from traditional schools.

        We have held steadfast to Lowell’s vision for over a century. Today, more than 14,000 students join us in our classrooms, and more than 800 degrees and 1,000 certificates are awarded each year.</p>

        <br>
        <h2>Our Commitment to the Future of Education : </h2>
        <p>As our world transitions fully to the knowledge economy, Harvard Extension School stands at the forefront of the greatest wave in education—that of open access and active learning.

            No one knows precisely what universities of the future will look like, but we can predict with some confidence that they will emphasize what we already value: increased quality and clear satisfaction of student expectations, with some combination of online and on-campus interaction—recognizing that different students learn in different ways.</p>
